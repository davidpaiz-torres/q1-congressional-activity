Congressional Activity on Pending Legislation for Q1 (3/22/2025 cutoff Date)

A few months ago, I put together a discord bot to track federal legislative proposals in the United States. Since we are a week away from Q2, I decided to create a graphic (find it on BlueSky or X @davidpaiztorres) showing Congress' most productive days (determined only by actions taken on pending legislation) in Q1.

The three most productive dates were: February 27, 2025, with 181 actions taken on pending legislation, January 3rd (first day of the 119th congress) with 179 actions taken, and March 11, 2025, with 161 actions taken. On average, there was 62 actions taken per day.

Actions can vary from a bill being introduced, passed, referred to or voted out of a committee. It can also include motions and amendment to a particular bill.
